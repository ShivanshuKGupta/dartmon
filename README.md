# Dartmon

A simple file watcher for Dart Projects. Can also be used to watch any other file types, or applications.

## Limitations

1. Watching for individual files changes is not available on Windows.
2. On Linux Systems, watching for new folders is not available. You may have to restart dartmon to watch the newly created folder.
